# Sailing-Index

### Description:
I sail a small dinghy sailboat. This exercise looks at historical weather data to determine the best days to sail based on wind and other meteorological data. The findings are visualized with daily scoring organized as two separate calendars â€“ one for just wind and the other encompassing a more complete daily weather profile.

### Tools Used:
SQL (BigQuery), Tableau

### Included Files:
1. Executive summary describing the purpose and the analysis.
2. Two visualizations showing relative quality of daily wind and weather, superimposed on the 2025 calendar.
3. The SQL code used to extract and process the data.
